<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a diligent and ambitious student with a strong academic background in Computer Science Engineering. I recently completed my diploma in CSE with distinction from AICTE-approved Government Polytechnic College, Maharaja's Technological Institute, Thrissur, where I proudly held the position of class topper. While I may not have professional experience yet, I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kottayam, with a passion for learning and a drive to excel in the field. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute to the tech industry's dynamic landscape.</p>
